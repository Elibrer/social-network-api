## Description
If you are looking to create your very own social media networking site, then this API if for you. The API is a framework for a working backend to this type of website, where users can create accounts with username and email, add their friends from the existing user database, post 'thoughts' (which can be changed to anything, e.g. posts, stories, videos, etc), and even react to other thoughts that have been already posted.

## Installation
Ensure `insomnia` has been installed on your system. For instructions on how to do this please visit [insomnia.rest](https://insomnia.rest/)

Ensure `mongoDB` has been installed on your system. For instructions on how to do this please visit: [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

Ensure `node.js` has been installed on your system. For instructions on how to do this please visit: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en). 


Once `node.js` has been installed the user can open the root directory of this application within any console or terminal type program. Check to see if you are in the right location by typing and entering:
```
ls
```
If the root directory is named `social-network-api` and there is a `server.js` file within, the user can then proceed. 

Next, the user may type and enter: 
```
npm install
```
to install all required packages found within the `package.json` file. This will install `mongoose`, `express.js`, and `dayjs`. 


If all of the required packages have been successfully installed the user may proceed by starting the application, typing and entering:

```
node server.js
```
or
```
npm start
```
into the console. If successful, the termial will display 'API server for social-network-api running on port 3001!', meaning the local server is up and running.
